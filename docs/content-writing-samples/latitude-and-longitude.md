# Latitude and Longitude

[![The Earth](/img/globe_west_2048.jpg)](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/latitude.html)

I wrote a pair of articles breaking down the facts about latitude and longitude as part of a series of 'Ocean Facts' on the National Ocean Service website. These are very technical topics, so the challenge here was to explain them in language suited to the average reader. I also wanted to tie the concepts into work that NOS does to further Earth science and ocean science.
