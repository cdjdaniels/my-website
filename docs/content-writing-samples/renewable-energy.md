# Ramping Up Renewable Energy

[![Offshore wind turbines](/img/wind-energy-turbines.jpg)](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/economy/wind-energy/welcome.html)

I wrote this article for the National Ocean Service exploring the ways the agency was supporting offshore wind projects in the United States. Because NOS's mandate is both to safeguard ocean resources *and* encourage trade, I tried to strike a balance between addressing economic factors and the agency's efforts to protect marine life and understand the impacts of offshore wind projects on ocean ecosystems.
