# Three Datums

[![Great Lakes satellite image](/img/great-lakes960.jpg)](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/geodesy/three-datums.html)

I wrote this article for the National Ocean Service website to explain three large changes in geodesy---the study of gravity. We used a Q&A format for the article because it was such a complex, technical topic. By breaking the material down into small chunks, it's easier to keep the reader's attention when dealing with lots of acronyms and jargon.
