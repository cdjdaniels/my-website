# About Me

![Courtney Daniels](/img/IMG_6374.jpeg)

As a science and technical writer and editor with 10 years' experience, I firmly believe that even the most highly technical content can be understandable, accessible, and engaging. Using simple sentence structure and plain English doesn't mean "dumbing it down." It's about communicating clearly! In fact, I believe the most complex topics require the simplest language, explanatory graphics, and clarifying examples. Not only does this approach make for engaging copy for native speakers, it will also open up your content to non-native speakers. 

I've spent a decade working with government agencies, absorbing best practices, and focusing on continuous improvement across various workflows. I've worked with subject matter experts who were overworked and sometimes uncooperative, but learned to focus everyone's attention on shared goals for the communication products. I've developed strategies to anticipate issues before they occur, juggle competing and overlapping deadlines, and make good decisions. In other words, I know how to make life easier for SMEs and managers.

## Editing Experience

My editing experience spans time at government agencies, including NASA and NOAA, commercial publishers, textbook publishers, and academic presses. I'm a skilled developmental editor, copyeditor, and proofreader who specializes in science and technical content. 

My favorite editing experiences come when editors are incorporated at the beginning of the process, rather than handed a manuscript and a hard deadline at the very end. Editors can provide valuable insight into organizing content, avoiding duplication, and creating a holistic message from disparate parts. This is particularly critical when work has been divided among different SMEs, all of whom may have differing ideas on what they want to say. 

At NASA, I led meetings I've come to call "content sprints"—not unlike design sprints and code sprints. Two or three days in a room without distractions, the entire cross-functional team focused on synthesizing research results and data into a cohesive whole. By the end of the "sprint," we had an outline for the team's report and a list of graphics to clarify the main points. These were, in a word, exhausting. But they were an incredibly effective tool to jumpstart the writing process and to incorporate everyone's contributions and opinions.

## Writing Experience

I've been a writer all my life. From fiction to social media to [web articles](../docs/category/content-writing-samples), I've done it all. During my time at NOAA, I wrote articles —which you can find in my portfolio—for the National Ocean Service website. These articles involved researching and synthesizing information from NOAA sources and elsewhere, distilling the broad set of facts into a cohesive narrative, writing compelling copy, and choosing effective graphics. They were also a lot of fun. 

I've also written executive summaries, as well as executive communication products \(blog posts, intranet posts, emails to employees, and oral remarks for internal and external audiences\). Unfortunately, I cannot share these in my portfolio since they were strictly internal to the agency. 


## Style and Language Guides

Part of a senior editor's job is to set the tone and guidance for your organization's written content. That includes minutiae like whether to use the Oxford comma \(yes, always\), but can also cover branding and formatting, ensuring an accessible final product, and fostering equity and inclusivity. 

In that capacity, I've written several [guides on inclusive language choices](docs/technical-writing-samples/inclusivity.md) and trained colleagues and SMEs in best practices. I researched heavily and collated the preferences of specific groups into one guide, providing lots of links to primary sources on inclusive language, such as the [GLAAD Media Reference Guide](https://glaad.org/reference) and the [National Association of Black Journalists Style Guide](https://nabjonline.org/news-media-center/styleguide/). I also incorporated feedback from others in the office with different perspectives from mine, doing my best to ensure my own implicit biases and assumptions were challenged and addressed. 

Language changes constantly, just as often as society does. When I conduct these trainings, I stress the fact that none of these guidelines are universal, nor will they stay static. But it's important nonetheless for people to begin making more considered choices with their language. It's not easy for someone working in the space industry for 30 years to start saying 'crewed' instead of 'manned', but after reading the guidelines they will at least understand why the change is happening, and I hope they will embrace it.
