# How to Convert a Draft Report to Final Format

*Note: Much of my work is property of the government and I cannot link to or include it in my portfolio. I have taken a real SOP that I wrote for my fellow editors and genericized it here.*

## Overview

This guide explains how to take draft report files and prepare a final report PDF for publication. Editors will need to complete these steps before circulating the final report PDF for SME review.

## Before you start

Before you convert the files, you need:

* The final draft report files (report and results-in-brief) from the appropriate project manager.
* The final report cover from the graphic designer.
* A publication number and issuance date.

## Reviewing Word files and converting to PDF

1. Conduct a final review of both Word documents.

    * Clear any major edits with the project manager.
    * Ensure all images and graphics have alternate text.
    * Add the publication number and issuance date on the first page of both documents.

2. Preparing the report PDF

    * Convert both Word documents to PDF by using the File -> Save as Adobe PDF function. Do not use the general Save As function; accessibility features will not work if you do.
    * You will now have three PDF files. Select all three in your file explorer and combine them into one PDF. 
    * Arrange the reports in the following order: final cover, RIB, and final report.

## Finalize the report PDF

1. In the file properties window:
    * The title field should match the file name.
    * Delete all author information.
    * Set the language to English 

2. Insert the 508-compliant PDF of management's comments. Complete the following steps:
    * Re-link the management's comments section in the Table of Contents.
    * Fix broken bookmarks in the Bookmarks panel.

3. Add a signature block at the end of the Recommendations section.

4. Save the file. 

## Next steps

Once you have the final report PDF, return it to the project manager for approval. If the project team has changes, incorporate them and repeat these steps as necessary.
